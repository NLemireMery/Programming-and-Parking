# Programming and Parking

Final submission for Junior Programmer Pathway w/ Unity.

## Programming

I'm using specific programming concepts to develop this little game, so that they feel more familiar when coding future projects.
Among those concepts, I will implement **data persistence**, **inheritance** (and **polymorphism**), **encapsulation** and **abstraction** (i.e. refactorization).
This is an object-oriented program.

## Parking

Use keyboard arrows to move 3 vehicles from point A (the parking entrance) to point B (their parking spot!).
Each vehicle works a bit differently than the others. 
You can't lose, but you're being timed. If you succeed in record times, your name and time will be displayed on the Wall of Parking Fame!
